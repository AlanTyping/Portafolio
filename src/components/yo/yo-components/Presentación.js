                    I'm an 18-year-old guy. Constantly setting different goals
                    just by thinking into projects that i consider to be
                    interesting. So, i can optimize my learning process just by actually learning
                    the stuff that i need in order to pursue my goals.
                </p>

                    Speaking a bit about myself, occasionally, i go out for a run.
                    Often, i interact with people through different communities and that helps me 
                    to be more socially active and learn new things while providing some value. I also like playing piano
                    and solving the rubik's cube, i think that those and also programming, are my main hobbies.
